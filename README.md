# Leaderboard API

The data in this project is sourced from a Google Sheet, which is converted into an API using [sheet.best](https://sheet.best). This allows for seamless integration of Google Sheets data into the project, making it easy to manage and update the leaderboard in real time.

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based leaderboard application, using Vite as the build tool and TailwindCSS for styling. The application provides a dynamic, real-time display of leaderboard data fetched directly from a Google Sheet API.
